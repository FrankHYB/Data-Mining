There are two python scripts, one deals with outliers the other one doesn't.
They are both written in python 2.7
If you run these two scripts in command line, you may need to install numpy:
>pip install numpy
Then you can kick off the script by using the command line:
>python script_name k
K could be user defined value which is no less than 5
5 is the default value
