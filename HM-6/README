Assignment 6 is written in python 2, some packages need to be installed before
successfully run the program
# First sklearn package
Scikit-learn requires:
Python (>= 2.6 or >= 3.3),
NumPy (>= 1.6.1),
SciPy (>= 0.9).

Then you can install sklearn 0.18.1, any version that is below 0.18 will cause compile error.
You can install sklearn 0.18.1 by running:
> pip install scikit-learn==0.18.1
I have encountered permission error, if you also encounter this error then using sudo
> sudo pip install scikit-learn==0.18.1

After you install all required packages, you can start running the program
> python "script_name" option
option is optional. If user don't specify the option, the program will default run the off-the-shelf implementation
option can be
    'softmax': choose softmax data mining algorithm
    'pca+knn': choose pca+knn as data mining algorithm

Our custom implementation (softmax and pca+knn) will be time consuming, it will run from 2 to 4 minutes which is also
dependent on the computer.
